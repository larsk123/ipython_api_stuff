# ipython_api_stuff
Plan of attck:
confortable w/ Jupyter Notebooks
1.do bunch of tutorials online and replicate. We do the same one
2.know how to get API data.
3.get API data into a database?
4.be able to query / manipulate data in database?
5.be able to use output from database to send data (sort of like sending a trade order, etc.)
6.create super basic website and deploy it live? I have a couple urls Iâ€™m not using
7.use that website and a database behind it to create our own little crypto currency project. So we have orders on there and it interact with a database and send/receive data via an API to say Coinbase.

also do machine learning and AI & incorporate somehow?
